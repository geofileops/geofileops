GeofileOps |version|
====================

This python library makes spatial operations on geo files fast and easy. 

It provides an easy to use API that can accomplish a lot with few lines of 
code. 
The processing will also be a lot faster than with many GIS libraries, 
because all available CPU's are used for geospatial operations. 

Most typical operations are available: buffer, simplify, dissolve, union, 
erase, intersect,...

Geofileops is tested on geopackage and shapefile input files.
