GeofileOps |version|
====================

This python library aims to make spatial operations on large geo files faster 
and easier. 

It provides an easy to use API that can accomplish a lot with few lines of 
code. To make processing faster, geofileops can use all available CPU's for 
spatial operations.
For operations like buffer this won't make a big difference as it doesn't need 
a lot of CPU power, but calculating the intersection between two large files, 
dissolving large files,... will be a lot faster.
The aim is that there is no size limit on the files that can be processed. 

Most typical operations are available: buffer, simplify, dissolve, union, 
erase, intersect,... 

Geofileops is tested on geopackage and shapefile input files. However, geopackage
is recommended as it will give better performance for most operations.
