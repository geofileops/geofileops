    Creates a new tempdir in the default temp location.

    Remark: the temp dir won't be cleaned up automatically!

    Examples:

        - base_dirname="foo" -> /tmp/foo_000001
        - base_dirname="foo/bar" -> /tmp/foo/bar_000001

    Args:
        base_dirname (str): The name the tempdir will start with. The name will be
            suffixed with a number to make the directory name unique. If a "/" is part
            of the base_dirname a subdirectory will be created: e.g. "foo/bar".
        parent_dir (Path, optional): The dir to create the tempdir in. If None, the
            system temp dir is used. Defaults to None.

    Raises:
        Exception: if it wasn't possible to create the temp dir because there
            wasn't found a unique directory name.

            Defaults to '.tmp'.
