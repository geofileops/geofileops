    """Dissolve geometries that are within the distance specified.

    The output layer will contain the dissolved geometries where all gaps between the
    input geometries up to ``distance`` are closed.

    Notes:
      - Only tested on polygon input.
      - Gaps between the individual polygons of multipolygon input features will also
        be closed.
      - The polygons in the output file are exploded to simple geometries.
      - No attributes from the input layer are retained.
      - If ``close_internal_gaps`` is False, the default, a ``gridsize`` > 0
        (E.g. 0.000001) should be specified, otherwise some input boundary gaps could
        still be closed due to rounding side effects.

    Alternative names:
      - ArcMap: aggregate_polygons (similar functionality)
      - Keywords: merge, dissolve, aggregate, snap, close gaps, union

    Args:
        input_path (PathLike): the input file.
        output_path (PathLike): the file to write the result to.
        distance (float): the maximum distance between geometries to be dissolved.
        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. If ``close_boundary_gaps`` is False, the default, a
            ``gridsize`` > 0 (E.g. 0.000001) should be specified, otherwise some
            boundary gaps in the input geometries could still be closed due to rounding
            side effects.
        close_internal_gaps (bool, optional): also close gaps, strips or holes in the
            input geometries that are narrower than the ``distance`` specified. E.g.
            small holes, narrow strips starting at the boundary,... Defaults to False.
        input_layer (str, optional): input layer name. If None, ``input_path`` should
            contain only one layer. Defaults to None.
        output_layer (str, optional): output layer name. If None, the ``output_path``
            stem is used. Defaults to None.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to -1: use all available CPUs.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a
            smaller ``nb_parallel``, will reduce the memory usage.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.
        force (bool, optional): overwrite existing output file(s).
            Defaults to False.

    """Applies a dissolve operation on the input file.

    If columns are specified with ``groupby_columns``, the data is first grouped
    on those columns before the geometries are merged.

    Data in other columns can be retained in the output by specifying the
    ``agg_columns`` parameter.

    Because the input layer is tiled using a grid to speed up, extra collinear points
    will typically be present in the output geometries. Rows with null or empty
    geometries are ignored.

    This is an example of how data in the columns that isn't grouped on can be
    aggregated to be added to the output file:

    .. code-block:: python

        gfo.dissolve(
            input_path="input.gpkg",
            output_path="output.gpkg",
            groupby_columns=["cropgroup"],
            agg_columns={
                "columns": [
                    {"column": "crop", "agg": "max", "as": "crop_max"},
                    {"column": "crop", "agg": "count", "as": "crop_count"},
                    {
                        "column": "crop",
                        "agg": "concat",
                        "as": "crop_concat",
                        "distinct": True,
                        "sep": ";",
                    },
                    {"column": "area", "agg": "mean", "as": "area_mean"},
                ]
            },
            explodecollections=False,
        )

    The following example will save all detailed data for the columns
    "crop_label" and "area" in the output file. The detailed data is encoded
    per group/row in a "json" text field. Shapefiles only support up to 254
    characters in a text field, so this format won't be very suited as output
    format for this option.

    .. code-block:: python

        gfo.dissolve(
            input_path="input.gpkg",
            output_path="output.gpkg",
            groupby_columns=["cropgroup"],
            agg_columns={"json": ["crop", "area"]},
            explodecollections=False,
        )

    This results in this type of output:
    ::

        cropgroup  json
        Grasses    ["{"crop":"Meadow","area":1290,"fid_orig":5}","{"crop":"Pasture",...
        Maize      ["{"crop":"Silo","area":3889.29,"fid_orig":2}","{"crop":"Fodder",...

    If the output is tiled (by specifying ``tiles_path`` or ``nb_squarish_tiles`` > 1),
    the result will be clipped on the output tiles and the tile borders are
    never crossed.

    Args:
        input_path (PathLike): the input file
        output_path (PathLike): the file to write the result to
        explodecollections (bool): True to output only simple geometries. If
            False, this can result in huge geometries for large files,
            especially if no ``groupby_columns`` are specified.
        groupby_columns (list[str] or str, optional): columns (case insensitive) to
            group on while aggregating. Defaults to None, resulting in a spatial union
            of all geometries that touch.
        agg_columns (dict, optional): columns to aggregate based on
            the groupings by groupby columns. Depending on the top-level key
            value of the dict, the output for the aggregation is different:

                - "json": dump all data per group to one "json" column. The
                  value can be None (= all columns) or a list of columns to include.
                - "columns": aggregate to seperate columns. The value should
                  be a list of dicts with the following keys:

                    - "column": column name (case insensitive) in the input file. In
                      addition to standard columns, it is also possible to specify
                      "fid", a unique index available in all input files.
                    - "agg": aggregation to use:

                        - count: the number of values in the group
                        - sum: the sum of the values in the group
                        - mean: the mean/average of the values in the group
                        - min: the minimum value in the group
                        - max: the maximum value in the group
                        - median: the median value in the group
                        - concat: all non-null values in the group concatenated (in
                          arbitrary order)

                    - "as": column name in the output file. Note: using "fid" as alias
                      is not recommended: it can cause errors or odd behaviour.
                    - "distinct" (optional): True to distinct the values before
                      aggregation.
                    - "sep" (optional): the separator to use for concat. Default: ",".

        tiles_path (PathLike, optional): a path to a geofile containing tiles.
            If specified, the output will be dissolved/unioned only within the
            tiles provided.
            Can be used to avoid huge geometries being created if the input
            geometries are very interconnected.
            Defaults to None (= the output is not tiled).
        nb_squarish_tiles (int, optional): the approximate number of tiles the
            output should be dissolved/unioned to. If > 1, a tiling grid is
            automatically created based on the total bounds of the input file.
            The input geometries will be dissolved/unioned only within the
            tiles generated.
            Can be used to avoid huge geometries being created if the input
            geometries are very interconnected.
            Defaults to 1 (= the output is not tiled).
        input_layer (str, optional): input layer name. If None, ``input_path`` should
            contain only one layer. Defaults to None.
        output_layer (str, optional): output layer name. If None, the ``output_path``
            stem is used. Defaults to None.
        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. Defaults to 0.0.
        where_post (str, optional): SQL filter to apply after all other processing,
            including e.g. ``explodecollections``. It should be in sqlite syntax and
            |spatialite_reference_link| functions can be used. Defaults to None.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to -1: use all available CPUs.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a
            smaller ``nb_parallel``, will reduce the memory usage.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.
        force (bool, optional): overwrite existing output file(s).
            Defaults to False.

        * :func:`select_two_layers`: select features using two input layers based on a

    Notes:
        By convention, the sqlite query can contain following placeholders that
        will be automatically replaced for you:

        * {geometrycolumn}: the column where the primary geometry is stored.
        * {columns_to_select_str}: if ``columns`` is not None, those columns, otherwise
          all columns of the layer.
        * {input_layer}: the layer name of the input layer.
        * {batch_filter}: the filter used to process in parallel per batch.

        Hint: often you will want to use f"" formatting on the SQL statement to fill out
        some parameters of your own as well. You can easily escape the placeholders
        above by doubling the "{" and "}", e.g. use {{geometrycolumn}} for
        {geometrycolumn}. Also check out the example below.

        Example: buffer all rows with a certain minimum area to the output file.

        .. code-block:: python

            minimum_area = 100
            sql_stmt = f"""
                SELECT ST_Buffer({{geometrycolumn}}, 1) AS {{geometrycolumn}}

                  FROM "{{input_layer}}" layer
                 WHERE 1=1
                   {{batch_filter}}
                   AND ST_Area({{geometrycolumn}}) > {minimum_area}
            """

                input_path="input.gpkg",
                output_path="output.gpkg",
                sql_stmt=sql_stmt,
            )

        Some important remarks:

        * Because some SQL statements won't give the same result when parallelized
          (eg. when using a group by statement), ``nb_parallel`` is 1 by default.
          If you do want to use parallel processing, specify ``nb_parallel`` + make
          sure to include the placeholder {batch_filter} in your ``sql_stmt``.
          This placeholder will be replaced with a filter of the form
          "AND rowid >= x AND rowid < y".
        * The name of the geometry column depends on the file format of the input file.
          E.g. for .shp files the column will be called "geometry", for .gpkg files the
          default name is "geom". If you use the {geometrycolumn} placeholder,
          geofileops will replace it with the correct column name for the input file.
        * If you apply (spatialite) functions on the geometry column always alias them
          again to its original column name, e.g. with "AS {geometrycolumn}".
        * Some SQL statements won't give correct results when parallelized/ran in
          multiple batches, e.g. when using a group by statement. This is why the
          default value for nb_parallel is 1. If you want to parallelize or run the
          query in multiple batches (by specifying ``nb_parallel`` != 1 or ``batchsize``
          > 0), you should make sure your query will give correct results if it is
          executed per batch of rows instead of once on the entire layer.
          Additionally, if you do so, make sure to include the placeholder
          {batch_filter} in your ``sql_stmt``. This placeholder will be replaced with a
          filter of the form "AND rowid >= x AND rowid < y" and will ensure every row is
          only treated once.
        * Table names are best double quoted as in the example, because some
          characters are otherwise not supported in the table name, eg. '-'.
        * It is recommend to give the table you select from "layer" as alias. If
          you use the {batch_filter} placeholder this is even mandatory.
        * When using the (default) "SQLITE" SQL dialect, you can also use the spatialite
          functions as documented here: |spatialite_reference_link|.
        * It is supported to use an attribute table (= table without geometry column) as
          input layer and/or not to include the geometry column in the selected columns.
          Note though that if the {columns_to_select_str} placeholder is used, it will
          start with a "," and if no column precedes it the SQL statement will be
          invalid.

    """Exports all features filtered by the specified spatial query.

    All features in ``input_to_select_from_path`` that comply to the
    ``spatial_relations_query`` compared with the features in
    ``input_to_compare_with_path`` are exported.

    The ``spatial_relations_query`` has a specific format. For most cases can use the
    following "named spatial predicates": contains, coveredby, covers, crosses,
    disjoint, equals, intersects, overlaps, touches and within.
    If you want even more control, you can also use "spatial masks" as defined by the
    |DE-9IM| model.

    Some examples of valid ``spatial_relations_query`` values:

        - "touches is True or within is True"
        - "intersects is True and touches is False"
        - "(T*T***T** is True or 1*T***T** is True) and T*****FF* is False"

    Args:
        input_to_select_from_path (PathLike): the 1st input file
        input_to_compare_with_path (PathLike): the 2nd input file
        output_path (PathLike): the file to write the result to
        spatial_relations_query (str, optional): a query that specifies the spatial
            relations to match between the 2 layers. Defaults to "intersects is True".
        min_area_intersect (float, optional): minimum area of the intersection.
            Defaults to None.
        area_inters_column_name (str, optional): column name of the intersect
            area. If None, no area column is added. Defaults to None.
        input1_layer (str, optional): 1st input layer name. If None,
            ``input_to_select_from_path`` should only contain one layer.
            Defaults to None.
        input1_columns (List[str], optional): list of columns to retain. If None, all
            standard columns are retained. In addition to standard columns, it is also
            possible to specify "fid", a unique index available in all input files. Note
            that the "fid" will be aliased eg. to "fid_1". Defaults to None.
        input2_layer (str, optional): 2nd input layer name. If None,
            ``input_to_compare_with_path`` should contain only one layer.
            Defaults to None.
        input2_columns (List[str], optional): NA.
        output_layer (str, optional): output layer name. If None, the ``output_path``
            stem is used. Defaults to None.
        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. Defaults to 0.0.
        where_post (str, optional): SQL filter to apply after all other processing,
            including e.g. ``explodecollections``. It should be in sqlite syntax and
            |spatialite_reference_link| functions can be used. Defaults to None.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to -1: use all available CPUs.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a
            smaller ``nb_parallel``, will reduce the memory usage.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.
        subdivide_coords (int, optional): the input geometries in the input to compare
            with layer will be subdivided to parts with about ``subdivide_coords``
            coordinates during processing which can offer a large speed up for complex
            geometries. If 0, no subdividing is applied. Defaults to 7.500.
        force (bool, optional): overwrite existing output file(s).
            Defaults to False.

    r"""Calculates the pairwise identity of the two input layers.

    The result is the equivalent of the intersection between the two layers + layer 1
    differenced with layer 2.

    Notes:
        - The result will contain the attribute columns from both input layers. The
          attribute values wont't be changed, so columns like area,... will have to be
          recalculated manually if this is wanted.
        - If ``input2_path`` is None, the 1st input layer is used for both inputs but
          interactions between the same rows in this layer will be ignored.
        - To speed up processing, complex input geometries are subdivided by default.
          For these geometries, the output geometries will contain extra collinear
          points where the subdividing occured. This behaviour can be controlled via the
          ``subdivide_coords`` parameter.

        input1_path (PathLike): the 1st input file.

            layer will be ignored.

            possible to specify "fid", a unique index available in all input files. Note
            that the "fid" will be aliased even if ``input1_columns_prefix`` is "", eg.
            to "fid_1". Defaults to None.
        input1_columns_prefix (str, optional): prefix to use in the column aliases.
            Defaults to "l1\_".
        input2_layer (str, optional): 2nd input layer name. If None, ``input2_path``

            stem is used. Defaults to None.
        explodecollections (bool, optional): True to convert all multi-geometries to
            singular ones after the dissolve. Defaults to False.
        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. Defaults to 0.0.

            parts with about ``subdivide_coords`` coordinates during processing which
            can offer a large speed up for complex geometries. Subdividing can result in
            extra collinear points being added to the boundaries of the output. If 0, no

    r"""Calculates the pairwise intersection of the two input layers.

    Notes:
        - The result will contain the attribute columns from both input layers. The
          attribute values wont't be changed, so columns like area,... will have to be
          recalculated manually if this is wanted.
        - If ``input2_path`` is None, the 1st input layer is used for both inputs but
          intersections between the same rows in this layer will be omitted from the
          result.
        - To speed up processing, complex input geometries are subdivided by default.
          For these geometries, the output geometries will contain extra collinear
          points where the subdividing occured. This behaviour can be controlled via the
          ``subdivide_coords`` parameter.

    Args:
        input1_path (PathLike): the 1st input file
        input2_path (PathLike): the 2nd input file. If None, the 1st input layer is used
            for both inputs but intersections between the same rows in this layer will
            be omitted from the result.
        output_path (PathLike): the file to write the result to
        input1_layer (str, optional): 1st input layer name. If None, ``input1_path``
            should contain only one layer. Defaults to None.
        input1_columns (List[str], optional): list of columns to retain. If None, all
            standard columns are retained. In addition to standard columns, it is also
            possible to specify "fid", a unique index available in all input files. Note
            that the "fid" will be aliased even if ``input1_columns_prefix`` is "", eg.
            to "fid_1". Defaults to None.
        input1_columns_prefix (str, optional): prefix to use in the column aliases.
            Defaults to "l1\_".
        input2_layer (str, optional): 2nd input layer name. If None, ``input2_path``
            should contain only one layer. Defaults to None.
        input2_columns (List[str], optional): columns to select. If None is specified,
            all columns are selected. As explained for ``input1_columns``, it is also
            possible to specify "fid". Defaults to None.
        input2_columns_prefix (str, optional): prefix to use in the column aliases.
            Defaults to "l2\_".
        output_layer (str, optional): output layer name. If None, the ``output_path``
            stem is used. Defaults to None.
        explodecollections (bool, optional): True to convert all multi-geometries to
            singular ones after the dissolve. Defaults to False.
        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. Defaults to 0.0.
        where_post (str, optional): SQL filter to apply after all other processing,
            including e.g. ``explodecollections``. It should be in sqlite syntax and
            |spatialite_reference_link| functions can be used. Defaults to None.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to -1: use all available CPUs.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a
            smaller ``nb_parallel``, will reduce the memory usage.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.
        subdivide_coords (int, optional): the input geometries will be subdivided to
            parts with about ``subdivide_coords`` coordinates during processing which
            can offer a large speed up for complex geometries. Subdividing can result in
            extra collinear points being added to the boundaries of the output. If 0, no
            subdividing is applied. Defaults to 15000.
        force (bool, optional): overwrite existing output file(s).
            Defaults to False.

    r"""Joins all features in input1 with all features in input2.

    The output will contain the geometries of input1. The ``spatial_relations_query``
    and ``min_area_intersect`` parameters will determine which geometries of input1 will
    be matched with input2.

    The ``spatial_relations_query`` has a specific format. Most cases can be covered
    using the following "named spatial predicates": contains, coveredby, covers,
    crosses, equals, intersects, overlaps, touches and within.
    If you want even more control, you can also use "spatial masks" as defined by the
    |DE-9IM| model.
    It is important to note that the query is used as the matching criterium for the
    join. Hence, it should not evaluate to True for disjoint features, as this would
    lead to a cartesian product of both layers. If it does, a warning will be triggered
    and "intersects is True" is added to the query.

    Some examples of valid ``spatial_relations_query`` values:

        - "intersects is True and touches is False"
        - "within is True or contains is True"
        - "(T*T***T** is True or 1*T***T** is True) and T*****FF* is False"

        - distance (float): if the dataset is in a planar (= projected) crs,
          ``distance`` will be in the unit defined by the projection (meters, feet,
          chains etc.). For a geographic dataset (longitude and latitude degrees),

          ``distance_crs`` will be in the unit defined by the projection (meters, feet,
          chains etc.). For a geographic dataset (longitude and latitude degrees),

        nb_nearest (int): the number of nearest features from input 2 to join
            to input1.
        distance (float): maximum distance to search for the nearest items. If
            ``expand`` is True, this is the initial search distance, which will be
            gradually expanded (doubled) till ``nb_nearest`` are found. For optimal

        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. Defaults to 0.0.
        where_post (str, optional): SQL filter to apply after all other processing,
            including e.g. ``explodecollections``. It should be in sqlite syntax and
            |spatialite_reference_link| functions can be used. Defaults to None.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use. If -1, all
            available cores are used. Defaults to 1. If ``nb_parallel`` != 1, make sure
            your query still returns correct results if it is executed per batch of rows
            instead of in one go on the entire layer.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per batch.
            A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a smaller
            ``nb_parallel``, will reduce the memory usage.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.
        force (bool, optional): overwrite existing output file(s).
            Defaults to False.

    Notes:
        By convention, the ``sql_stmt`` can contain following placeholders that
        will be automatically replaced for you:

        * {layer1_columns_prefix_str}: komma seperated columns of
          layer 1, prefixed with "layer1"
        * {layer1_columns_prefix_alias_str}: komma seperated columns of
          layer 1, prefixed with "layer1" and with column name aliases
        * {layer1_columns_from_subselect_str}: komma seperated columns of
          layer 1, prefixed with "sub"
        * {input1_databasename}: the database alias for input 1
        * {input2_layer}: name of input layer 1
        * {input2_geometrycolumn}: name of input geometry column 2
        * {layer2_columns_prefix_str}: komma seperated columns of
          layer 2, prefixed with "layer2"
        * {layer2_columns_prefix_alias_str}: komma seperated columns of
          layer 2, prefixed with "layer2" and with column name aliases
        * {layer2_columns_from_subselect_str}: komma seperated columns of
          layer 2, prefixed with "sub"
        * {layer2_columns_prefix_alias_null_str}: komma seperated columns of
          layer 2, but with NULL for all values and with column aliases
        * {input2_databasename}: the database alias for input 2

          processing

        in input2 on join_id.

        Some important remarks:

        * Because some SQL statements won't give the same result when parallelized
          (eg. when using a group by statement), ``nb_parallel`` is 1 by default.
          If you do want to use parallel processing, specify ``nb_parallel`` + make
          sure to include the placeholder {batch_filter} in your ``sql_stmt``.
          This placeholder will be replaced with a filter of the form
          "AND rowid >= x AND rowid < y".
        * Table names are best double quoted as in the example, because some
          characters are otherwise not supported in the table name, eg. "-".
        * When using supported placeholders, make sure you give the tables you
          select from the appropriate table aliases (layer1, layer2).
        * Besides the standard sqlite SQL syntacs, you can use the spatialite
          functions as documented here: |spatialite_reference_link|
        * It is supported to use attribute tables (= table without geometry column)
          as input layers and/or not to include the geometry column in the selected
          columns. Note though that if the column placeholders are used (e.g.
          {layer1_columns_prefix_str}), they will start with a "," and if no column
          precedes it the SQL statement will be invalid.

    See Also:
        * :func:`select`: select features from a layer based on a SQL query

    Examples:
        An ideal place to get inspiration to write you own advanced queries
        is in the following source code file: |geoops_sql_link|.

        Additionally, there are some examples listed here that highlight
        other features/possibilities.

        **Join nearest features with filter**

        To join nearest features, geofileops has a specific :meth:`~join_nearest`
        function. This provides a fast way to find the nearest feature(s) if there
        doesn't need to be a filter on the features to be found.

        For a use case where for each element in layer 1, you want to find the nearest
        features in layer 2 while applying a filter that eliminates many kandidates,
        the query below will be a better solution.

        Note: Using ``MIN(ST_Distance(layer1.geom, layer2.geom)`` sometimes seems to
        round the distances calculated slightly resulting in some nearest features not
        being found. Using ``RANK`` avoids this issue.
