    Dissolve geometries that are within the distance specified.

    The output layer will contain the dissolved geometries where all gaps between the
    input geometries up to `distance` are closed.

    Notes:
      - Only tested on polygon input.
      - Gaps between the individual polygons of multipolygon input features will also
        be closed.
      - The polygons in the output file are exploded to simple geometries.
      - No attributes from the input layer are retained.
      - If `close_internal_gaps` is False, the default, a `gridsize` > 0
        (E.g. 0.000001) should be specified, otherwise some input boundary gaps could
        still be closed due to rounding side effects.

    Args:
        input_path (PathLike): the input file.
        output_path (PathLike): the file to write the result to.
        distance (float): the maximum distance between geometries to be dissolved.
        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. If `close_boundary_gaps` is False, the default, a
            `gridsize` > 0 (E.g. 0.000001) should be specified, otherwise some boundary
            gaps in the input geometries could still be closed due to rounding side
            effects.
        close_internal_gaps (bool, optional): also close gaps, strips or holes in the
            input geometries that are narrower than the `distance` specified. E.g. small
            holes, narrow strips starting at the boundary,... Defaults to False.
        input_layer (str, optional): input layer name. Optional if the input
            file only contains one layer.
        output_layer (str, optional): input layer name. Optional if the input
            file only contains one layer.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to -1: use all available CPUs.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a
            smaller nb_parallel, will reduce the memory usage.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.

        where_post (str, optional): sql filter to apply after all other processing,
            including e.g. explodecollections. It should be in sqlite syntax and
            |spatialite_reference_link| functions can be used. Defaults to None.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to -1: use all available CPUs.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a

            Defaults to False.

    Examples:
        This example shows the basic usage of `gfo.apply`:
        ::

            import geofileops as gfo

            gfo.apply(

            )

    Applies a buffer operation on geometry column of the input file.

    The result is written to the output file specified.

    If ``explodecollections`` is False and the input and output file type is GeoPackage,
    the fid will be preserved. In other cases this will typically not be the case.

    Args:
        input_path (PathLike): the input file
        output_path (PathLike): the file to write the result to
        distance (float): the buffer size to apply. In projected coordinate
            systems this is typically in meter, in geodetic systems this is
            typically in degrees.
        quadrantsegments (int): the number of points a quadrant needs to be
            approximated with for rounded styles. Defaults to 5.
        endcap_style (BufferEndCapStyle, optional): buffer style to use for a
            point or the end points of a line. Defaults to ROUND.

              * ROUND: for points and lines the ends are buffered rounded.
              * FLAT: a point stays a point, a buffered line will end flat
                at the end points
              * SQUARE: a point becomes a square, a buffered line will end
                flat at the end points, but elongated by "distance"
        join_style (BufferJoinStyle, optional): buffer style to use for
            corners in a line or a polygon boundary. Defaults to ROUND.

              * ROUND: corners in the result are rounded
              * MITRE: corners in the result are sharp
              * BEVEL: are flattened
        mitre_limit (float, optional): in case of join_style MITRE, if the
            spiky result for a sharp angle becomes longer than this ratio limit, it
            is "beveled" using this maximum ratio. Defaults to 5.0.
        single_sided (bool, optional): only one side of the line is buffered,
            if distance is negative, the left side, if distance is positive,
            the right hand side. Only relevant for line geometries.
            Defaults to False.
        input_layer (str, optional): input layer name. Optional if the input
            file only contains one layer.
        output_layer (str, optional): input layer name. Optional if the input
            file only contains one layer.
        columns (List[str], optional): list of columns to retain. If None, all standard
            columns are retained. In addition to standard columns, it is also possible
            to specify "fid", a unique index available in all input files. Note that the
            "fid" will be aliased eg. to "fid_1". Defaults to None.
        explodecollections (bool, optional): True to output only simple geometries.
            Defaults to False.
        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. Defaults to 0.0.
        keep_empty_geoms (bool, optional): True to keep rows with empty/null geometries
            in the output. Defaults to False.
        where_post (str, optional): sql filter to apply after all other processing,
            including e.g. explodecollections. It should be in sqlite syntax and
            |spatialite_reference_link| functions can be used. Defaults to None.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to -1: use all available CPUs.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a
            smaller nb_parallel, will reduce the memory usage.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.
        force (bool, optional): overwrite existing output file(s).
            Defaults to False.

    Because the input layer is tiled using a grid to speed up, extra collinear points
    will typically be present in the output geometries. Rows with null or empty
    geometries are ignored.

    This is an example of how data in the columns that isn't grouped on can be
    aggregated to be added to the output file:
    ::

        import geofileops as gfo

        gfo.dissolve(
            input_path=...,
            output_path=...,
            groupby_columns=["cropgroup"],
            agg_columns={
                "columns": [
                    {"column": "crop", "agg": "max", "as": "crop_max"},
                    {"column": "crop", "agg": "count", "as": "crop_count"},
                    {
                        "column": "crop",
                        "agg": "concat",
                        "as": "crop_concat",
                        "distinct": True,
                        "sep": ";",
                    },
                    {"column": "area", "agg": "mean", "as": "area_mean"},
                ]
            },
            explodecollections=False,
        )

    The following example will save all detailed data for the columns
    "crop_label" and "area" in the output file. The detailed data is encoded
    per group/row in a "json" text field. Shapefiles only support up to 254
    characters in a text field, so this format won't be very suited as output
    format for this option.
    ::

        import geofileops as gfo

        gfo.dissolve(
            input_path=...,
            output_path=...,
            groupby_columns=["cropgroup"],
            agg_columns={"json": ["crop", "area"]},
            explodecollections=False,
        )

    This results in this type of output:
    ::

        cropgroup  json
        Grasses    ["{"crop":"Meadow","area":1290,"fid_orig":5}","{"crop":"Pasture",...
        Maize      ["{"crop":"Silo","area":3889.29,"fid_orig":2}","{"crop":"Fodder",...

    If the output is tiled (by specifying ``tiles_path`` or ``nb_squarish_tiles`` > 1),
    the result will be clipped on the output tiles and the tile borders are
    never crossed.

    Args:
        input_path (PathLike): the input file
        output_path (PathLike): the file to write the result to
        explodecollections (bool): True to output only simple geometries. If
            False, this can result in huge geometries for large files,
            especially if no groupby_columns are specified.
        groupby_columns (Union[List[str], str], optional): columns (case insensitive) to
            group on while aggregating. Defaults to None, resulting in a spatial union
            of all geometries that touch.
        agg_columns (dict, optional): columns to aggregate based on
            the groupings by groupby columns. Depending on the top-level key
            value of the dict, the output for the aggregation is different:

                - "json": dump all data per group to one "json" column. The
                  value can be None (= all columns) or a list of columns to include.
                - "columns": aggregate to seperate columns. The value should
                  be a list of dicts with the following keys:

                    - "column": column name (case insensitive) in the input file. In
                      addition to standard columns, it is also possible to specify
                      "fid", a unique index available in all input files.
                    - "agg": aggregation to use:

                        - count: the number of values in the group
                        - sum: the sum of the values in the group
                        - mean: the mean/average of the values in the group
                        - min: the minimum value in the group
                        - max: the maximum value in the group
                        - median: the median value in the group
                        - concat: all non-null values in the group concatenated (in
                          arbitrary order)

                    - "as": column name in the output file. Note: using "fid" as alias
                      is not recommended: it can cause errors or odd behaviour.
                    - "distinct" (optional): True to distinct the values before
                      aggregation.
                    - "sep" (optional): the separator to use for concat. Default: ",".

        tiles_path (PathLike, optional): a path to a geofile containing tiles.
            If specified, the output will be dissolved/unioned only within the
            tiles provided.
            Can be used to avoid huge geometries being created if the input
            geometries are very interconnected.
            Defaults to None (= the output is not tiled).
        nb_squarish_tiles (int, optional): the approximate number of tiles the
            output should be dissolved/unioned to. If > 1, a tiling grid is
            automatically created based on the total bounds of the input file.
            The input geometries will be dissolved/unioned only within the
            tiles generated.
            Can be used to avoid huge geometries being created if the input
            geometries are very interconnected.
            Defaults to 1 (= the output is not tiled).
        input_layer (str, optional): input layer name. Optional if the
            file only contains one layer.
        output_layer (str, optional): input layer name. Optional if the
            file only contains one layer.
        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. Defaults to 0.0.
        where_post (str, optional): sql filter to apply after all other processing,
            including e.g. explodecollections. It should be in sqlite syntax and
            |spatialite_reference_link| functions can be used. Defaults to None.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to -1: use all available CPUs.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a
            smaller nb_parallel, will reduce the memory usage.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.
        force (bool, optional): overwrite existing output file(s).
            Defaults to False.

    Execute an SQL query on the file.

    By convention, the sqlite query can contain following placeholders that
    will be automatically replaced for you:

      * {geometrycolumn}: the column where the primary geometry is stored.
      * {columns_to_select_str}: if 'columns' is not None, those columns, otherwise all
        columns of the layer.
      * {input_layer}: the layer name of the input layer.
      * {batch_filter}: the filter used to process in parallel per batch.

    Hint: often you will want to use f"" formatting on the sql statement to fill out
    some parameters of your own as well. You can easily escape the placeholders above by
    doubling the "{" and "}", e.g. use {{geometrycolumn}} for {geometrycolumn}. Also
    check out the example below.

    Example: buffer all rows with a certain minimum area to the output file.
    ::

        import geofileops as gfo

        minimum_area = 100
        sql_stmt = f'''
                SELECT ST_Buffer({{geometrycolumn}}, 1) AS {{geometrycolumn}}
                      {{columns_to_select_str}}
                  FROM "{{input_layer}}" layer
                 WHERE 1=1
                   {{batch_filter}}
                   AND ST_Area({{geometrycolumn}}) > {minimum_area}
                '''
        gfo.select(
                input_path=...,
                output_path=...,
                sql_stmt=sql_stmt)

    Some important remarks:

    * The name of the geometry column depends on the file format of the input file. E.g.
      for .shp files the column will be called "geometry", for .gpkg files the default
      name is "geom". If you use the {geometrycolumn} placeholder, geofileops will
      replace it with the correct column name for the input file.
    * If you apply (spatialite) functions on the geometry column always alias them again
      to its original column name, e.g. with "AS {geometrycolumn}".
    * Some sql statements won't give correct results when parallelized/ran in
      multiple batches, e.g. when using a group by statement. This is why the default
      value for nb_parallel is 1. If you want to parallelize or run the query in
      multiple batches (by specifying nb_parallel != 1 or batchsize > 0), you should
      make sure your query will give correct results if it is executed per batch of
      rows instead of once on the entire layer.
      Additionally, if you do so, make sure to include the placeholder {batch_filter}
      in your sql_stmt. This placeholder will be replaced with a filter of the form
      'AND rowid >= x AND rowid < y' and will ensure every row is only treated once.
    * Table names are best double quoted as in the example, because some
      characters are otherwise not supported in the table name, eg. '-'.
    * It is recommend to give the table you select from "layer" as alias. If
      you use the {batch_filter} placeholder this is even mandatory.
    * When using the (default) "SQLITE" sql dialect, you can also use the spatialite
      functions as documented here: |spatialite_reference_link|.
    * It is supported to use an attribute table (= table without geometry column) as
      input layer and/or not to include the geometry column in the selected columns.
      Note though that if the {columns_to_select_str} placeholder is used, it will
      start with a "," and if no column precedes it the SQL statement will be invalid.

    The result is written to the output file specified.

    Args:
        input_path (PathLike): the input file
        output_path (PathLike): the file to write the result to
        sql_stmt (str): the statement to execute
        sql_dialect (str, optional): the sql dialect to use. If None, the default sql
            dialect of the underlying source is used. Defaults to "SQLITE".
        input_layer (str, optional): input layer name. Optional if the input
            file only contains one layer.
        output_layer (str, optional): input layer name. Optional if the input
            file only contains one layer.
        columns (List[str], optional): list of columns to retain, if
            {columns_to_select_str} is used. If None, all standard
            columns are retained. In addition to standard columns, it is also possible
            to specify "fid", a unique index available in all input files. Note that the
            "fid" will be aliased eg. to "fid_1". Defaults to None.
        explodecollections (bool, optional): True to convert all multi-geometries to
            singular ones. Defaults to False.
        force_output_geometrytype (GeometryType, optional): The output geometry type to

        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change

        keep_empty_geoms (bool, optional): True to keep rows with empty/null geometries
            in the output. Defaults to True.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to 1. If nb_parallel != 1, make sure your query still returns
            correct results if it is executed per batch of rows instead of in one go
            on the entire layer. To use all available cores, pass -1.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a
            smaller nb_parallel, will reduce the memory usage. If batchsize != -1,
            make sure your query still returns correct results if it is executed per
            batch of rows instead of in one go on the entire layer.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.
        force (bool, optional): overwrite existing output file(s). Defaults to False.

    Joins all features in input1 with all features in input2.

    The output will contain the geometries of input1. The spatial_relations_query and
    min_area_intersect parameters will determine which geometries of input1 will be
    matched with input2.

    The spatial_relations_query is a filter string where you can use the following
    "named spatial predicates": equals, touches, within, overlaps, crosses, intersects,
    contains, covers, coveredby.

    If you want even more control, you can also use "spatial masks" as defined by the
    [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM) model.

    Examples for valid spatial_relations_query values:

        - "overlaps is True and contains is False"
        - "(T*T***T** is True or 1*T***T** is True) and T*****FF* is False"

    Joins features of `input1` with the `nb_nearest` closest features of `input2`.

    In addition to the columns requested via the `input*_columns` parameters, the
    following columns will be in the output file as well:
        - pos (int): relative rank (sorted by distance): the closest item will be #1,
          the second closest item will be #2 and so on.
        - distance (float): if the dataset is in a planar (= projected) crs, `distance`
          will be in the unit defined by the projection (meters, feet, chains etc.).
          For a geographic dataset (longitude and latitude degrees), `distance` will be
          in meters, with the most precise geodetic formulas being applied.
        - distance_crs (float): if the dataset is in a planar (= projected) crs,
          `distance_crs` will be in the unit defined by the projection (meters, feet,
          chains etc.). For a geographic dataset (longitude and latitude degrees),
          `distance_crs` will be in angles. Only available with spatialite >= 5.1.

    Note: if spatialite version >= 5.1 is used, parameters `distance` and `expand` are
    mandatory.

    Args:
        input1_path (PathLike): the input file to join to nb_nearest features.
        input2_path (PathLike): the file where nb_nearest features are looked for.
        output_path (PathLike): the file to write the result to
        nb_nearest (int): the number of nearest features from input 2 to join
            to input1.
        distance (float): maximum distance to search for the nearest items. If `expand`
            is True, this is the initial search distance, which will be gradually
            expanded (doubled) till `nb_nearest` are found. For optimal performance,
            it is important to choose the typical value that will be needed to find
            `nb_nearest` items. If `distance` is too large, performance can be bad.
            Parameter is only relevant if spatialite version >= 5.1 is used.
        expand (bool): `True` to keep searching till nb_nearest items are found. If
            `False`, only items found within `distance` are returned (`False` is only
            supported if spatialite version >= 5.1 is used).

    Some important remarks:

    * Because some sql statement won't give the same result when parallelized
      (eg. when using a group by statement), nb_parallel is 1 by default.
      If you do want to use parallel processing, specify nb_parallel + make
      sure to include the placeholder {batch_filter} in your sql_stmt.
      This placeholder will be replaced with a filter of the form
      'AND rowid >= x AND rowid < y'.
    * Table names are best double quoted as in the example, because some
      characters are otherwise not supported in the table name, eg. '-'.
    * When using supported placeholders, make sure you give the tables you
      select from the appropriate table aliases (layer1, layer2).
    * Besides the standard sqlite sql syntacs, you can use the spatialite
      functions as documented here: |sqlite_reference_link|
    * It is supported to use attribute tables (= table without geometry column) as
      input layers and/or not to include the geometry column in the selected columns.
      Note though that if the column placeholders are used (e.g.
      {layer1_columns_prefix_str}), they will start with a "," and if no column precedes
      it the SQL statement will be invalid.

    Additionally, there are some examples listed here that highlight
    other features/possibilities.

    *Join nearest features*

    For each feature in layer1, get the nearest feature of layer2 with the
    same values for the column join_id.

        .. code-block:: sqlite3

            WITH join_with_dist AS (
                SELECT layer2.{{input2_geometrycolumn}}

                      ,ST_Distance(layer2.{{input2_geometrycolumn}}
                      ,layer1.{{input1_geometrycolumn}}) AS distance
                 FROM {{input1_databasename}}."{{input1_layer}}" layer1
                 JOIN {{input2_databasename}}."{{input2_layer}}" layer2
                   ON layer1.join_id = layer2.join_id
                )
            SELECT *
              FROM join_with_dist jwd
             WHERE distance = (
                   SELECT MIN(distance) FROM join_with_dist jwd_sub
                    WHERE jwd_sub.l1_join_id = jwd.l1_join_id)

        input1_layer (str, optional): input layer name. Optional if the
            file only contains one layer. Defaults to None.
        input1_columns (List[str], optional): list of columns to retain. If None, all
            standard columns are retained. In addition to standard columns, it is also
            possible to specify "fid", a unique index available in all input files. Note

        input2_columns (List[str], optional): columns to select. If None is specified,
            all columns are selected. As explained for input1_columns, it is also
            possible to specify "fid". Defaults to None.
        input2_columns_prefix (str, optional): prefix to use in the column aliases.
            Defaults to "l2_".
        output_layer (str, optional): output layer name. If None, the output_path stem
            is used. Defaults to None.
        explodecollections (bool, optional): True to convert all multi-geometries to
            singular ones after the dissolve. Defaults to False.
        gridsize (float, optional): the size of the grid the coordinates of the ouput
            will be rounded to. Eg. 0.001 to keep 3 decimals. Value 0.0 doesn't change
            the precision. Defaults to 0.0.
        where_post (str, optional): sql filter to apply after all other processing,
            including e.g. explodecollections. It should be in sqlite syntax and
            |spatialite_reference_link| functions can be used. Defaults to None.
        nb_parallel (int, optional): the number of parallel processes to use.
            Defaults to -1: use all available CPUs.
        batchsize (int, optional): indicative number of rows to process per
            batch. A smaller batch size, possibly in combination with a
            smaller nb_parallel, will reduc
            e the memory usage.
            Defaults to -1: (try to) determine optimal size automatically.
        subdivide_coords (int, optional): the input geometries will be subdivided to
            parts with about subdivide_coords coordinates during processing which can
            offer a large speed up for complex geometries. Subdividing can result in
            extra collinear points being added to the boundaries of the output. If < 0,
            no subdividing is applied. Defaults to 2000.
        force (bool, optional): overwrite existing output file(s).
