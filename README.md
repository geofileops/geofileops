This python library aims to make it easier and faster to develop spatial analysis on
large vector GIS files.

It provides an easy to use API that can accomplish a lot with few lines of code.

Most typical GIS operations are available: e.g. 
[buffer](https://geofileops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/geofileops.apply.html#geofileops.buffer), 
[simplify](https://geofileops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/geofileops.apply.html#geofileops.simplify),
[dissolve](https://geofileops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/geofileops.apply.html#geofileops.dissolve),
[union](https://geofileops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/geofileops.apply.html#geofileops.union),
[erase](https://geofileops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/geofileops.apply.html#geofileops.erase)/difference, 
[intersection](https://geofileops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/geofileops.apply.html#geofileops.intersection),...

To make processing faster, these operations can use all available CPU's. In some cases
(complex) geometries will be cut in tiles to speed up processing further.
For operations like buffer this won't make a big difference as it doesn't need a lot of
CPU power, but calculating the intersection between two large files, dissolving large
files,... will be a lot faster.

The aim is that there is no size limit on the files that can be processed on standard
hardware.

Geofileops is tested on geopackage and shapefile input files. However, geopackage
is recommended as it will give better performance for most operations.

Documentation on how to use geofileops can be found [here](https://geofileops.readthedocs.io).

The following chart gives an impression of the speed improvement that can be expected
when processing larger files (including I/O!). More information about this benchmark can
be found [here](https://github.com/geofileops/geobenchmark).
